- Each branch has to be created from its parent branch only.
- Branch is named exactly as its ticket on Jira.
- If your sub-task is the first one ,you have to create its parent story branch before you start.
- Your commit is the same text of the ticket title on Jira.
- After pushing your branch, create a PR merging to your parent branch, and assign a reviewer. (inProgress ==> codeReview)
- Send your PR link to your reviewer.
- The reviewer starts revision. (codeReview ==> codeReview inProgress)
- If you get approval, merge your branch and DELETE it. (codeReview inProgress ==> ready QA)
